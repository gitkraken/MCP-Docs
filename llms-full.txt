# GitKraken MCP Documentation

> Official documentation for the GitKraken Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server — a tool that connects AI agents and IDEs to GitKraken's git, issue tracking, and pull request workflows via the MCP standard.

The GitKraken MCP Server can be installed via GitLens (bundled, no setup required) or the GitKraken CLI. It exposes tools and prompts that allow AI agents to perform git operations, manage issues, review pull requests, and more across GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Azure DevOps.

# Getting Started with the GitKraken MCP Server

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/mcp/MCP-getting-started/
Last updated: February 2026

You can install the GitKraken MCP Server through GitLens or the GitKraken CLI. This guide walks you through installation in supported IDEs.

## Install via GitLens

The GitKraken MCP Server is bundled with GitLens for VS Code version 1.101.0 and later. No manual setup is required.

If you're using an older version of VS Code (prior to 1.101.0), install the MCP Server from the command palette in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or other VS Code-based IDEs.

You can also install the MCP Server directly using the following deeplinks:
- VS Code: https://gitkraken.dev/deeplink?product=gitlens&path=/link/command/install-mcp&ide=vscode
- VS Code Insiders: https://gitkraken.dev/deeplink?product=gitlens&path=/link/command/install-mcp&ide=vscode-insiders
- Cursor: https://gitkraken.dev/deeplink?product=gitlens&path=/link/command/install-mcp&ide=cursor
- Windsurf: https://gitkraken.dev/deeplink?product=gitlens&path=/link/command/install-mcp&ide=windsurf
- Trae: https://gitkraken.dev/deeplink?product=gitlens&path=/link/command/install-mcp&ide=trae

Each link handles all required configuration automatically.

### Verify installation

1. Ensure you are in Agent Mode.
2. Click the gear icon in the lower-right corner of the Copilot side panel.

## GitKraken CLI

You can also install the GitKraken MCP Server using the GitKraken CLI. After installation, run the following command to authenticate:

```
gk auth login
```

Once authenticated, add the MCP server to your preferred agent.

# Example Workflows

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/mcp/MCP-example-workflows/
Last updated: February 2026

Explore these example workflows to learn how the GitKraken MCP Server can automate everyday development tasks.

## Query Jira and GitHub for Assigned Issues

Manually checking Jira or GitHub for your assigned issues can be tedious. Instead, ask your agent:

```
What issues are assigned to me?
```

This prompt uses the `issues_assigned_to_me` tool to query Jira and/or GitHub and list all issues assigned to your account.

## Start Work on a Jira Issue

To start work on a specific task, use the following prompt:

```
Start work on Jira issue <issue-id>
```

Replace `<issue-id>` with the actual issue ID. The MCP Server will call the `issues_get_detail` tool, fetch issue details, check your workspace, and create a new branch for that issue.

Depending on your agent and model, your IDE may then modify related files or call tools such as `git_status` and `git_add_or_commit`.

## Debug and Understand History

While GitLens helps visualize commit history, it depends on meaningful commit messages. You can use the MCP Server to investigate change history automatically.

Ask:

```
Who last changed the <function-name> function and why?
```

The MCP Server will call the `git_blame` tool and relevant Git commands to gather and summarize context for you.

# Tools Reference

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/mcp/MCP-tools-reference/
Last updated: February 2026

Tools are a fundamental part of the MCP ecosystem. They are the building blocks of the GitKraken Model Context Protocol (MCP) and allow you to interact with git and the integrations you have set up such as GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Azure DevOps.

You can enable/disable them specifically within your chosen AI IDE/Agent. This list will change over time as we add more tools and consolidate the existing ones.

## Git Tools

- git_add_or_commit: Add file contents to the index (`git add <pathspec>`) or commit changes (`git commit -m <message> [files...]`). Use the `action` parameter to specify which operation to perform.
- git_blame: Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file (`git blame <file>`).
- git_branch: List or create branches (`git branch`).
- git_checkout: Switch branches or restore working tree files (`git checkout <branch>`).
- git_log_or_diff: Show commit logs or changes between commits (`git log --oneline` or `git diff`).
- git_push: Update remote refs along with associated objects (`git push`).
- git_stash: Stash the changes in a dirty working directory (`git stash`).
- git_status: Show the working tree status (`git status`).
- git_worktree: List or add git worktrees (`git worktree <action>`).

## GitKraken Tools

- gitlens_start_review: Gets PR details, opens a new worktree and window, opens the diff view, and starts an agent on review.
- gitlens_start_work: Gets issue details, opens a new worktree and window, and starts an agent on work.

## Issues Tools

- issues_add_comment: Add a comment to an issue.
- issues_assigned_to_me: Fetch all issues assigned to the current user.

# Prompts Reference

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/mcp/MCP-prompts-reference/
Last updated: February 2026

Prompts are a higher level feature of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). They help you save time on repetitive tasks by bundling preconfigured text prompts that also help enforce the usage of specific tools at the right time for the right workflow.

You can think of them as bundled workflows that help save you typing time when prompting. This list will change over time as we add more prompts and fine-tune the existing ones.

## Code Review Prompts

- code_review_branch: Generate a code review branch name based on the provided context.
