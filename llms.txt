# GitKraken MCP Documentation

> Official documentation for the GitKraken Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server — a tool that connects AI agents and IDEs to GitKraken's git, issue tracking, and pull request workflows via the MCP standard.

The GitKraken MCP Server can be installed via GitLens (bundled, no setup required) or the GitKraken CLI. It exposes tools and prompts that allow AI agents to perform git operations, manage issues, review pull requests, and more across GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Azure DevOps.
